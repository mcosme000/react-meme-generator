# ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This is a simple React App that is part of the Scrimba React course.
It fetches data from the meme API and shows random memes whenever the button is clicked.
I added a second form so that users can search for memes trough keywords.


## Next steps

- If the user search returns more than one image, create a Carrousel component
